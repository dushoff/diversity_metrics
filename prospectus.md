Mean Rarity prospectus



In the User’s Guide to Measuring Species Diversity (Roswell, Dushoff, Winfree, In Review), we echoed a realization that Hill diversities can be expressed as a weighted mean over the population, specifically the mean species rarity (Patil and Taillie 1982). In this paper we present interpretations of Hill diversities and recent diversity partitions that emerge from considering diversity as mean rarity, and also present tools for estimating population diversity from sample data that emerge from statistical theory about the generalized mean.



One challenge in the current literature about hill diversity is understanding the units, the effective numbers scale. We offer the alternative unit, rarity, to complement the interpretation of these measures, and contrast the verbal definitions that match the “effective numbers” framework and the “mean rarity” framework for several recent diversity and differentiation measures (Chao and Chiu 2016). In so doing, we also illustrate some important properties of the Chao and Chiu diversity partition, and extend our previous description of mean rarity to bridge alpha, beta, and gamma scales.



The second goal of this paper is to derive and present generalized estimators for species rarity based on finite-pool sampling assumptions. The weights used in averaging species rarity in Hill diversities are, and intuitively, should be, the proportional abundances of each observed species. But in estimating diversity for the community rather than the sample, we may wish to replace observed rarities with an estimator. Such an estimator is necessary to account for the fact that many high rarity species are typically undetected in a small sample. Furthermore, small sample rarities converge on population rarities rapidly while large rarities are subject to large variation even in large samples. To develop generalized (i.e. applicable for any arbitrary power in a power mean) estimators, we presume that finite-pool-size estimates are required. We anticipate that even if this project ends up re-deriving previously suggested estimators, the mean rarity framework will provide tools for evaluating bias, accuracy, and sample size requirements for estimating diversity from samples.
