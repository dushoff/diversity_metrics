# testing statistical coverage of coverage still to do
# 4)  for each SAD, bin observations, say 100 at a time, by true coverage. This means that in each bin you'd have 100 samples of very similar true coverage, they may have a variety of different sample sizes.
# 
# 5) For each bin, make a boxplot or similar for each Hill number. Goal is to visualize mean diversity given coverage, and the distribution. Should be clean-looking. Record mean diversity, mean coverage for each bin, hill number.
# 
# do similar to before but this time focus on chao estimated diversities

#     a) if target sample coverage is above or below true sample coverage for that sample
#     b) for each Hill diversity, if expected diversity for that coverage is in, below, or above Chao's interval
# c) sample stats like actual sample size, diversity, coverage
