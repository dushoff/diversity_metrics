### R scripts

*Gods_Unbiased_Estimator.R* compares mean rarity estimates where true rarities are known and sample abundances used in mean estimation (Gods unbiased estimator) to diversity estimates from other (less divine) realms

*just_scales.R* unsophisticated script to plot the different scales, with no data besides a handful of reference points


*balance.R* includes functions to take an observed SAD and plot abundance and rarity on various scales with mean as the fulcrum

## md files
*notes.md* currently has some to-do notes and various bits on Chao estimation and generalizing the good-turing logic to estimating rarity

*outline.md* is a rough MS outline

*prospectus.md* is MS prospective
